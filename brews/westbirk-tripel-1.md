Tripel recipe based on David Heath's co-fermentation tripel [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LFIkTovJ5I].

#### Grist
- 3800g pils (Castle, 3 EBC)
- 185g Caramel MÃ¼nich I (BESTMALTZ 90 EBC)
- 600g table sugar

#### Hops
- 9g Magnum @ 60 min
- 23g Saaz @ 15 min

#### Yeast
- Mangrove Jack's M31
- Lallemand Voss Kviek

#### Other ingredients
- 2ml lactic acid (80%) - mash
- 1.8g (a pinch?) table salt - mash

11.5L wort @ 1.082 (target 1.079)

SG 1.010 measured 10/2
FG 1.010-08 measured 14/2. Put in basement for cold crashing.

Bottled 17/2. 70g sugar and 2dL boiled for 5 minutes and added to 10.5L beer.

NOTER:
19/2: Lightly carbonated. Heavy banana aroma. Maybe more of a saison than tripel?

21/2: Lightly carbonated still. Much less banana aroma. More of a balanced, but quite heavily spicy flavour.

3/3: Well carbonated but could maybe use a bit more for next brew. Spicy notes seem way more subdued.
