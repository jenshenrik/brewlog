Antaget OG 1.060. Brewfather udregner 1.054

### Bottling
10L bottled on 7/2 using 67g DME for carbonation.

## Tasting notes
Lacks mouthfeel. Maybe mash at higher temp, and/or use another yeast. WY1968, maybe?

Slight roast character. Use Carafa Special II instead of chocolate malt, or try capping

Maybe a bit too dark? Check recipe against actual EBC values used. Some grains might have switched color/amout. Not critical. 
- Recipe calls for 23 EBC Münich I, not 90 EBC Caramel Münich I. This is probably the main culprit re. color.
- Recipe calls for 110 EBC Cara Crystal, not 150 EBC Crystal
- Brown malt is listed at slightly lighter than recipe, though (120 vs 150 EBC)
