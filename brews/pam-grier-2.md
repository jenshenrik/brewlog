### Notes
**Mash:** Mashed in at 68°C, 9.75L. Salts and lactic acid added. Mash started at approx. 70°C. Dropped to 68°C after a couple of minutes. Temp. down to 64°C after about 25 minutes, so pot briefly turned on. Overshot and raised it to 71°C. Left lid off and stirred to bring down to 68°C. Mashed out at approx. 65°C after 45 minutes. 4.5L first runnings collected.

**Sparge:** Batch sparged with 9.25L of water approx. 76°C. 11.5L second runnings collected.

BG approx. 1.044 (1.040 at 35°C) vs. expected 1.049. Looks very dark and smells roasty. Probably shouldn't have doubled the amount of Carafa.

Just shy of 12L wort collected, yeast pitched at about 20°C. OG 1.060.

Gravity measured at 1.012 4/3.

Swirled a couple of times in an attempt to rouse yeast 5/3-6/3.

Put in the basement for cold crashing 9/3. Dryhops added 10/3.
